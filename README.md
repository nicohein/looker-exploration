# Looker Exploration

In this repository I am collecting a few patterns that I started to use while developing LookML and a few ideals for potential LookML improvements.


## Patterns

- [Sorting by row totals when hitting the row limit with pivot](product_sales/sort_by_row_totals.md)


## Feature Requests

- [Liquid](hypothetical_code/liquid.md)
- [Aggregate awareness and the Join](product_sales/aggregate_awareness_and_the_join.md)
